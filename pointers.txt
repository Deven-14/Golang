Programs start running in package main.



In Go, a name is exported if it begins with a capital letter. For example, Pizza is an exported name, as is Pi, which is exported from the math package.

pizza and pi do not start with a capital letter, so they are not exported.

When importing a package, you can refer only to its exported names. Any "unexported" names are not accessible from outside the package.



A function can take zero or more arguments & can return any number of results.

In this example, add takes two parameters of type int.

Notice that the type comes after the variable name.

func add(x int, y int) int { return x + y }
func add(x, y int) int { return x + y }
func swap(x, y int) (int, int) { return y, x }


Go's return values may be named. If so, they are treated as variables defined at the top of the function.
These names should be used to document the meaning of the return values.
A return statement without arguments returns the named return values. This is known as a "naked" return.
Naked return statements should be used only in short functions, as with the example shown here. They can harm readability in longer functions.

func split(sum int) (x, y int) {
    x = sum / 2
    y = sum - x
    return
}




The var statement declares a list of variables; as in function argument lists, the type is last.
A var statement can be at package or function level.

var a, b, c int

A var declaration can include initializers, one per variable.
If an initializer is present, the type can be omitted; the variable will take the type of the initializer.

var a, b = 1, true
a := 5

Outside a function, every statement begins with a keyword (var, func, and so on) and so the := construct is not available.




Basic Types in Go

bool
string
int  int8  int16  int32  int64
uint uint8 uint16 uint32 uint64 uintptr
byte // alias for uint8
rune // alias for int32 // represents a Unicode code point
float32 float64
complex64 complex128

When you need an integer value you should use int unless you have a specific reason to use a sized or unsigned integer type.

Variables declared without an explicit initial value are given their zero value.
The zero value is:
0 for numeric types,
false for the boolean type, and
"" (the empty string) for strings.




Constants are declared like variables, but with the const keyword.
Constants can be character, string, boolean, or numeric values.
Constants cannot be declared using the := syntax.

const a int = 5
const b = 10.2



Numeric constants are high-precision values.
An untyped constant takes the type needed by its context.
const (
    Big = 1 << 100
    Small = Big >> 99
)




Flow control statements: for, if, else, switch and defer



For
Go has only one looping construct, the for loop.

The basic for loop has three components separated by semicolons:

the init statement: executed before the first iteration
the condition expression: evaluated before every iteration
the post statement: executed at the end of every iteration
The init statement will often be a short variable declaration, and the variables declared there are visible only in the scope of the for statement.

The loop will stop iterating once the boolean condition evaluates to false.

Note: Unlike other languages like C, Java, or JavaScript there are no parentheses surrounding the three components of the for statement and the braces { } are always required.

func sumOfN1(n int) (sum int) {
	for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
		sum += i
	}
	return sum
}

The init and post statements are optional.

func sumOfN2(n int) (sum int) {
	i := 0
	for ; i < n; {
		sum += i
		i ++
	}
	return sum
}

func sumOfN2(n int) (sum int) {
	i := 0
	for ; i < n; {
		sum += i
		i ++
	}
	return sum
}

func sumOfN2(n int) (sum int) {
	i := 0
	for i < n {
		sum += i
		i++
	}
	return sum
}

If you omit the loop condition it loops forever, so an infinite loop is compactly expressed.

func main() {
	for {
	}
}





If 
Go's if statements are like its for loops; the expression need not be surrounded by parentheses ( ) but the braces { } are required.

Like for, the if statement can start with a short statement to execute before the condition.
Variables declared by the statement are only in scope until the end of the if.

if z := 5; z > 0 {
    fmt.Println(z)
}




Swtich
Go's switch is like the one in C, C++, Java, JavaScript, and PHP, except that Go only runs the selected case, not all the cases that follow. In effect, the break statement that is needed at the end of each case in those languages is provided automatically in Go. 
Another important difference is that Go's switch cases need not be constants, and the values involved need not be integers.

Switch evaluation order
Switch cases evaluate cases from top to bottom, stopping when a case succeeds.

(For example,

switch i {
case 0:
case f():
}
does not call f if i==0.)

Switch with no condition
Switch without a condition is the same as switch true.
This construct can be a clean way to write long if-then-else chains.

func main() {
	t := time.Now()
	switch {
	case t.Hour() < 12:
		fmt.Println("Good morning!")
	case t.Hour() < 17:
		fmt.Println("Good afternoon.")
	default:
		fmt.Println("Good evening.")
	}
}
